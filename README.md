# Responsive-Hamburger-Menu
## Author: Nirmith Victor D'Almeida

In this one we can change our screen sizes and it will convert from a normal nav-bar to a hamburger menu when it reaches a phone of a mini sized screen tablet.

## But Why Did I Do This?
> Main reason is I plan to use this as a template whenever I am building something that would need a navigational section page
> I just wanted to revisit the olde css and develop my understanding of it's uses further

## Who can use it?
> anyone and everyone can I took it off the net and after a slight tweak here and there to make it close whenever we click a link in the menu

#### Upcoming Idea
I will try to make a node server/ pug version of this where wer can either write it in every file or we can create a common file and have that implemented.
